For the first player you must create the minimax tree until you reach a terminal node(a state which a player has won or there is a draw) or a cutoff state. Then you must use an evaluation function to score the leafs and find the next best move. For the second player you must do all the above however when you are playing as max there is a probability that you will choose a random move instead of the best move.\n",
