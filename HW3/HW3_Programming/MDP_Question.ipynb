    "## Section 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce the concepts of MDP, Q-values, and V-values. These concepts are fundamental to the field of AI and machine learning, as they are used to model **decision-making problems** in various domains such as \"robotics\", \"finance\", and \"healthcare\".\n",
    "\n",
    "MDP stands for Markov Decision Process. It is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making problems in which the outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker. MDPs are defined by a set of states, a set of actions, a reward function, and a transition function. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-values and V-values are two important concepts in the context of MDPs. A Q-value represents the expected cumulative reward of taking a particular action in a particular state and following a specific policy thereafter. A V-value represents the expected cumulative reward of being in a particular state and following a specific policy thereafter. These values are used to evaluate and improve the policy of an agent in an MDP."

    "## Section 2: The Basics of MDPs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explain the basic components of an MDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "An MDP is defined by \"a set of states\", \"a set of actions\", \"a reward function\", and \"a transition function\". The state space is the set of all possible states that the agent can be in. The action space is the set of all possible actions that the agent can take. The reward function defines the reward the agent receives for each action taken in a particular state. The transition function defines the probability of moving from one state to another state after taking a particular action.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these concepts, let's consider an example of a **robot that needs to navigate through a maze**. The robot can be in one of several states, such as at the start of the maze, at a junction in the maze, or at the end of the maze. This robot takes an action. With Probability of **0.8** It goes in that desired direction but with probability of **0.2** It goes in the perpendicular direction (0.1, 0.1 for each)!\n",
    "\n",
    "In an MDP, the agent interacts with the environment by selecting actions based on its current state and the expected future reward. The goal of the agent is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time."
