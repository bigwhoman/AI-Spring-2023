              Each of the edges in the graph show a \textbf{conditional relationship}, meaning that if an edge goes from A to B, A would be the evidence for P[B|A]. The
              edges \textbf{don't necessarily} show dependancy because the \textbf{knowledge of other nodes} could lead to d-seperation of two nodes of an edge.

    \item \phantom{text}
          \begin{latin} \noindent
              We could for example draw the edge from node B to F or turn the graph into a full graph.

          \begin{latin} \noindent
              If a bayesian network is a complete graph, we could conclude that it each of the variables of the network is related to other variables(nodes) and all nodes have direct casual relationship with each other. In a complete graph, the complexity of network analasys is rather high.\\
              If a bayesian network is an empty graph, it means that there are no relations between the nodes of the bayesian network and all nodes are \textbf{conditionally independant of each other}.
